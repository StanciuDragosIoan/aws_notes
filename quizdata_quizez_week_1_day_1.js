What is AWS? 

What is CLoud Computing? 

-on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing 
-instead of buying owning or maintaining physical infrastructure,  you can access technology 
 services like computing power, storage and DBs on an as-needed basis from providers like AWS

Who uses cloud computing?
-many organizations of various sizes use it for data backup, disaster recovery,
email, virtual desktops, development and testing

Benefits of Cloud Computing:

Agility (easy access to broad range of technology so we can innovate faster - spin up and deploy 
resources easy or decomission them if needed)

Elasticity (no need to over provision resources up front, instead we can provision only what we need and 
scale up or down as required)

Cost savings (trade fixed expenses e.g. data centers/servers for variable expenses, pay onlywhay ou 
consume - economies of scale)

Deploy Globally (we can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes (putting
apps closer to users reduces latency)

Types of Cloud Computing

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS - contains the basic building blocks. It provides access to networking features,
computers - virtual or on dedicated hardware- and data storage space)

Platform s a Service - PaaS (it manages the underlying infrastructure - hardware and OS, software maintenance,
patching, etc)

Software as a Service (SaaS)

provides a complete product              (ran and managed by a service provider) e.g. web based email


What are Cloud Services?

resources managed by AWS and delivered on demand over the internet

What are Cloud Managed Services

services whose underlying infrastructure is managed by AWS - these services require hardware, OS, etc... managed by
AWS which monitors and maintains them


E.G. of services

Resizable compute capacity
DB and Storage
AI/ML
Networkign and Content Delivery

AWS GLobal infrastructure
spans 114 availability zones within 36 geographic regions serving 245 countries

Benefits:

security, availability, performance, scalability, flexibility, global footpoint (largest global infra)
