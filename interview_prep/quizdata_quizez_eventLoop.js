/*

NodeJS Event Loop

It is what allows NodeJS to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that 
a single JS thread is used by default - by offloading operations to the system kernel
whenever possible.

Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing 
in the background. When one of these operations completes, the kernel tells NodeJS so that 
the appropriate callback is added to the poll queue (or callback queue) to eventually be 
executed.

Libuv is the C library that implements the NodeJS event loop and all of the async behaviours of 
the platform.

The event loop phases

timers
pending callbacks
idle,prepare
poll (incoming connections/data, etc...)
check phase
close callbacks phase


Each phase has a FIFO queue of callbacks to execute. When the event loop enters a phase, it will perform
all operations specific to that phase, then execute callbacks in that phase's queue until it finishes (ur
until the maximum number of callbacks has been executed). Then it moves to the next phase.

Timers

- specify the threshold after which a provided callback may be executed rather than the exact time a person
wants it to be executed

Pending callbacks

-executes callbacks for some system operations such as types of TCP errors (e.g. ECONNREFUSED)

Poll

-this phase allows the event loop to execute callbacks after the poll phase ended


Close Callbacks

-if a handle is closed abruptly (e.g. socket.destroy()), the 'close' event will be emitted in this phase
